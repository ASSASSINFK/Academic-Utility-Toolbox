# C# Academic Utility Toolbox (WinForms)
This project is a multi-functional utility application developed as part of my Software Engineering studies. It serves as a comprehensive toolkit, integrating several mathematical and logical tools into a single, user-friendly Windows Forms interface.

## Features
The application provides a modular suite of tools, including:

Interactive Calculator: Full-featured calculation panel.

Multiplication Table Generator: Automated table generation logic.

Prime Number Checker: Algorithm for identifying prime numbers.

Factorial Calculator: Mathematical logic for factorial operations.

Guess the Number Game: Logic-based interactive mini-game.

## Technical Specifications
Language: C#

Framework: .NET Windows Forms

UI Logic: Uses a dynamic panel visibility system for seamless transitions between tools.

Architecture: Developed with clean-code principles, ensuring a modular structure where each utility is isolated.
